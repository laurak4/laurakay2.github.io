        <p>I love to cook food. I have a <strong>passion for trying new food from different cultures.</strong> Recently, I've been learning how to cook Lao and Thai food. I have been learning how to make <a href="https://cookingwithlane.com/khao-piak-sen-lao-chicken-noodle-soup/">Khao Piek.</a> I hope I can explore more food from around the world!</p>
